Git's push --force is destructive because it
 unconditionally overwrites the remote repository with whatever you have locally, 
 possibly overwriting any changes that a team member has pushed in the meantime. 
 However there is a better way; the option --force-with-lease can help when you do 
 need to do a forced push but still ensure you don't overwrite other's work.
